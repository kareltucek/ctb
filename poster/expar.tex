This figure shows transformations needed for employment of control flow. The first transformation replaces simple control-flow operations by new subgraphs, creating new edges which carry data via buffers. The graph of its components of connectedness (w.r.t. solid lines)(a \emph{factor graph}) is not acyclic (as the attached factor graph shows). The second transformation removes all cycles by means of insertion of new buffers. 

\ 

\ 

  We need to obtain acyclic factor graph because we wish to process components (aka basic blocks) atomically, i.e., without leaving for processing of other components and especially without re-entering the same block again. Cycles and loops in the factor graph correspond exactly to paths containing buffers which return to their originating componentss.
