\def\Abstract{%
The center of our interest is a problem of pipelined realisation of a special case of data processing networks. These realisations are supposed to realise some computations on series of independent data sets while utilizing SIMD instructions. The aim of this paper is to theoretically investigate the possibilities and the problems of employment of control flow in these networks and also to implement a general framework suitable for generation of these realisations.

The main idea is utilisation of an algorithm crawling over partitions of a network factorised with respect to its control flow. Our idea is that SIMD parallelism should take place on the same instruction realised across multiple data sets.

We illustrate the problems relevant to employment of branching and loops in these networks. We especially discuss a problem of data ordering and also provide relevant proofs. In the analytical part, we show implementation of a general framework which we believe to be suitable for processing of these networks. We also provide examples utilising Intel's SIMD Streaming Extensions.
