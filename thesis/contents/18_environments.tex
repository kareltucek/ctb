Implementation of an entirely new environment, e.g., providing support for an entirely new language, a SSE extension and a target distributed environment, may require the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Implementation of a new instruction table.
  \item Implementation of a new alias environment. 
  \item Implementation of a new language formatter, unless you are fine with non-formatted output files. In that case feel free to use the \texttt{language\_empty} structure.
  \item If a new control flow strategy or new types of control flow nodes are to be introduced, a new graph transformer may also be neccessary.
\end{enumerate}

The first two things which the user should think about are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Representation of vectorized data types. All elements need to retain the correct order when being split or merged.
  \item Exact strategy of employment of control flow.
\end{itemize}
